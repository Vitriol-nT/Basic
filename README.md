As I recently learned class and stuff,
I came up with writing simple stuff like this.

Still in the process of learning it.
This thing, as you can read the code, does not exactly simulates
the physics at all. instead it looks it works like it.

It also features bouncing off from a designated surface accorded to user.
It uses simple vector reflections and 'Z = tangent (X - val) + tangent (Y - val)' form
of plane to utilze the function.

PS> covering this with UI would be also great.

Usage pictures below:
