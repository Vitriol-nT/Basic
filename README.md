As I recently learned class and stuff,
I came up with writing simple stuff like this.

Still in the process of learning it.
This thing, as you can read the code, does not exactly simulates
the physics at all. instead it looks it works like it.

it only simulates the ball bouncing on the ground.
However, i will simulate ball bouncing on slopes using Vector reflections soon. --> update: i did it but something is off bruh

PS> covering this with UI would be also great.
